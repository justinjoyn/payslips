```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd payslips
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Local Development

To run the app locally on your development machine:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser.

## Running on Devices

### iOS

To run the app on iOS devices or simulator:
```
npx cap run ios
```
OR
```
npx cap open ios
```

This command will open the project in Xcode. From Xcode, you can choose a simulator or connect your iOS device and run the app.

```
OR
```
npx cap open android
```

```

This command will create a production build of your app in the `build` directory.

## Capacitor Commands

### Syncing Changes

After making any changes to your web code, you need to sync those changes with the native projects:

```
npx cap sync
```

This command copies the web assets to each native project.

### Updating Capacitor

To update Capacitor to the latest version:

```
npm install @capacitor/core@latest
npx cap update
```

This command updates Capacitor to the latest version and syncs native changes.
